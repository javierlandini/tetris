I started this as an exercise following a discussion I saw on social media about an interview where it was requested to build a Tetris game in less than an hour.

It took more than an hour to me, but I wanted to proof myself I was able to do it, and it sounded like a fun exercise to try.

You can play this game at [https://tetris-omega-tan.vercel.app/](https://tetris-omega-tan.vercel.app/).
